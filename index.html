            <p class="card-text">I had the opportunity to travel to Africa in January 1999 and stay for three weeks as part of a collage work-study program.  This trip was an incredible time to see and experience the unique African culture.  The people, the food, the culture was all so wonderful to experience.  The above picture is similar to the waterfalls we saw in Zimbabwee called Victoria Falls.  It was unlike anything I've ever seen and it was simply astonishing.

            <p>We also had an amazing opportunity to stay at a Gaming Park and to go on four safari expeditions in South Africa and Zimbabwee led by locals.  Two outings were early in the morning and two were at dusk.  This allowed us to see a vast number of animals in their natural habitat which was a once-in-a-lifetime excursion.  I'm very grateful for the chance to take this trip and it's something I'll always remember.  I was able to bring home hand-carved chess boards, original paintings by street artists, and so much more as a way to commerate the trip.</p>
